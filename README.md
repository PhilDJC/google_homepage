The idea of this project is to deconstruct  a webpage and rebuild it; in order to think about how elements fit on a page and roughly how they get styled and aligned 

L / O:
Two ways to move a div around on the page </br>
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page </br>
Identify the background color of an existing webpage </br>
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage </br>
Center an element horizontally </br>
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page </br>
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page </br>
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere) </br>
